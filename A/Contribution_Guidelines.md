# üíó Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute with useful marketing article, video, podcast, tool or other relevant content, send us a Pull Request.  Please, follow these guidelines:
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. Briefly check the content in the selected category to ensure that your suggestions don‚Äôt repeat existing.   
* **Make an individual Pull Request for each suggestion.**
* Try to make your Pull Request as descriptive as possible. Mention, how this content or tool helped you. We do hope, that you personally read, watch, listen or use stuff, that you‚Äôre recommending.
* Put your content as the last item in the category.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are more than welcome!
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period and remove trailing whitespace.
* Please, check your spelling and grammar.
* Feel free to add Emoji :bowtie:

## üîó Link Format
Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests:
* ``[Title of the Article](link) by Author\Company``.
Feel free to change the title for more clear and appropriate, if needed. Unfortunately, many good marketing articles have a fuzzy clickbait titles, that don't
show the meaning of the content. That is good for getting clicks, but not for understanding the article value.
* ``[Name of the tool](link)``. Mention, how the tool helped you and if it has a free trial or features.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Requirements
* Your submitted content or tool should be useful for other engineers. Obviously, it must be relevant for marketing, analytic, biz dev, sales, PR or growth hacking tasks.
* Content should be up to date, well-written and well-structured. It can be an old article or some popular tool, but it must be relevant.
* Video and podcast should be done in a good English, so engineers from all around the globe could understand it!
* Please, don‚Äôt submit shameless promotion stuff with million popups and ‚Äúsign now‚Äù forms. A lot of great marketing content is spoiled with this destructive self-promotion. We try to avoid it in our list.
* Software & hardware focus of the content is a plus, but not required.
* Tools can be paid, but it should have a pricing plan for individuals. Please, don‚Äôt submit tools, which are oriented on marketing agencies and cost an enormous amount of money.


## üîÆ Review Workflow  
We will do our best to review your submission as soon as we can. However, we would love to take a deep look on it and it might take time. Please, consider that we have a full-time job in our startup :)

Your contribution might be rejected, if the content or tool didn't pass our curation. This can be for multiple reasons: poorly written, too much self-promotion, not relevant to the community in general, etc. Of course, this is very subjective and if you think we (Lisa and Ahmed) are being unfair, do let us know.
